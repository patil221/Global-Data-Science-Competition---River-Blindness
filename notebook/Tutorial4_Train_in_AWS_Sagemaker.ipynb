    "# Tutorial 4: Train your model in an AWS Sagemaker training job\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial, we trained and evaluated a first model on small dummy data. While it is possible to train a model within [Sagemaker Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQc8Itd4UTs&list=PLhr1KZpdzukcOr_6j_zmSrvYnLUtgqsZz) it's better to use a Sagemaker training job instead. Sagemaker training jobs have several advantages over a normal notebook. Sagemaker training jobs, namely they\n",

    "- do not automatically shut down after a few hours (which we enabled in the notebooks)\n",
    "- allows to run multiple training jobs in parallel (if you have sufficient GPUs allocated)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will convert the approach from tutorial 3 into a Sagemaker training job and train our model on the full data set. During the training, the logs are send to [Cloudwatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) - aws' monitoring service. After the training completed, the model is saved and automatically uploaded to S3. From there we'll retrieve the model and evaluate it.\n",

Hence it makes sense to turn this into a separate module and import it where necessary. You can find the code for this in ```src/Dataset.py```. The configuration will probably be changed during different experiments. Similarly, the logic might change a bit once we start using different training and testing datasets. Therefore we put these two into a separate file called ```src/tutorial_4_training.py```. The intend is to have a separate file for each training job in order to make everything reproduceable and easily comparable. Note that for a longer project you'll probably want to set up a proper experiment tracking tool like [Sagemaker Experiments](https://sagemaker-experiments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/)."
